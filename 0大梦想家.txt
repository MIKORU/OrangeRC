大梦想家

小凯：
?一个一个梦飞出了天窗
One by one my dreams fly out of windows?
一次一次想穿梭旧时光
Time and time again I want time travel
?
二源：?
雨再大 也总要回家
Rain’s heavy, still need to go back
?被淋湿的鞋 晒干再出发
Though shoes are wet, dry them and depart?
轻松的步伐 被泥土冲刷
The jaunty footsteps, washed away by muds
?力量无限放大
Power’s infinitely enlarged

?小凯：
?我们 被小事打扰
We are, bothered by trifles?
为心事烦恼 骨骼和时间赛跑
Worried by troubles, racing with time for our growth
?未来的最佳男主角
The best actor in the future?
准没准备好
Are you ready to go

?千玺：
?带着光
Take your light?
跟我飞翔
Follow me to fly
?感受风的速度在耳边 呼啸远方
Feel that speed of wind by our ears, wuthering afar
?
合唱：
?一个一个梦飞出了天窗
One by one my dreams fly out of windows?
一次一次想穿梭旧时光
Time and time again I want time travel?
插上竹蜻蜓张开了翅膀
Putting on take-copter I blow my wings?
飞到任何想要去的地方
Fly to anywhere that I want to go
?一个一个梦写在日记上
One by one I keep my dreams on diary?
一点一点靠近诺贝尔奖
Step by step I approach Nobel prize?
只要你敢想就算没达到理想
Even though our goal is not fulfilled as we dreamed?
至少 有回忆珍藏
We still have memories to keep
?
二源：
?我们 慢慢地生长
We are growing up slowly
?从小的愿望 到大的梦想 起航
Start from wishes, to departure of bigger dreams
?
小凯：
?坚持是生命的永恒
Persistence goes to eternity?
跳动的心脏
Our hearts are beating
?
千玺：?带着光
Take your light?
跟我飞翔
Follow me to fly?
感受风的速度在耳边
Feel that speed of wind by our ears
?
合唱：?呼啸远方
Wuthering afar

?Rap『小凯』：?
未来是什么样
What does further look like?
心未眠夜未央
No rest at endless night?
像钻石一样闪亮
Like a diamond let us shine?oooh！?
站在逆风的方向
If you stand against the wind?
反而更大声的唱
You should yell louder to sing?YOLO
青春 就一次疯狂
YOLO you only live once
